# Care Hospital Database Management System

## Summary
The Care Hospital Database Management System project aims to create a comprehensive and efficient database system to manage hospital operations. This system facilitates the storage, retrieval, and management of patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, medical histories, billing information, and more. By leveraging SQL, this project provides an organized and accessible way to handle large volumes of data, ensuring data integrity and improving operational efficiency.

## Explanation of Data
The database design includes several key tables:
- **Patients**: Contains information about patients, including personal details, contact information, and medical history.
- **Doctors**: Stores details about doctors, including specialties, contact information, and schedules.
- **Appointments**: Manages patient appointments with doctors, including date, time, and purpose.
- **Billing**: Tracks billing information for patient services, including charges, payments, and outstanding balances.
- **Medical Records**: Contains detailed records of patient diagnoses, treatments, and medications.

Each table is designed with appropriate relationships and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.
